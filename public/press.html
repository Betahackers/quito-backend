                <h1>What happens when 30 creative freelancers from Barcelona lock themselves indoors for a weekend?</h1>

                <p>On the weekend of 12th and 13th April, 2014, 30 freelancers from Barcelona's "Betahaus" coworking space challenged themselves to design, build and launch a tech project in less than 36 hours.</p>

                <p>The aim was to build a project which would pull together the wide variety of skills of all the members - from programmers, designers and copywriters, to marketing experts, musicians and illustrators.</p>

                <p>Taking place over just one weekend, the team would need to fast-track the development of their project into just 36 hours - creating a concept, designing the interface, programming the website and iOS application, creating the content and launching the product with a complete promotional plan.</p>

                <p>The result?</p>

                <h2>Fromto - The guide from Betahaus to Barcelona</h2>
                <p>Fromto is a new, unique Barcelona city guide - from the members of the "Betahaus"
                    co-working space, to anybody who finds themselves in Barcelona.</p>

                <p>This native iOS application and website has been designed to lead you off the beaten track and into
                    the coolest bars, cafes, parks, trails and hidden corners of the city.</p>

                <p>Each of the team's members have reviewed some of their favourite places to hang-out in Barcelona, and
                    categorised them accordingly.  Feeling romantic? Let Yonah Forst, a Betahaus member from New York,
                    recommend you a great place to go on a date.  Fancy a stroll?  Fabienne, an Austrian graphic designer,
                    knows some great places away from the crowds.</p>

                <h2>How it happened</h2>

                <p>A week before the event took place, the team met to brainstorm some ideas and discuss what skills would be available on the weekend.  The resulting ideas were narrowed down to a set of four, and a vote confirmed that a new guide to Barcelona was our chosen project.</p>

                <p>A few days later, the event began at 10am on the morning of Saturday, April 12th 2014. After some breakfast and much-needed coffee, the development team outlined some realistic targets for the day, based on the amount of available resources and time we had.</p>

                <p>The team then divided into four groups - software developers, graphic designers, content and marketing - and invited anybody with an interest in a particular area to get involved and take the opportunity to learn something new.</p>

                <p>Over the next 36 hours, the four teams worked tirelessly to create Fromto.  Within hours, the marketing team had presented a concept and name for the app, and later worked on a full promotional campaign.  The content team were responsible for defining what content would be available, and began the collection process.  Despite the brutal deadlines, the design team delivered first wireframes, and later full design specifications.  The development team built a back-end content management system, as well as a web front-end and an iOS app.</p>

                <p>When the team weren't working on the project, they kept themselves busy playing Guitar Hero, recording their experience in the "diary room", and eating cakes that other team members had baked.</p>

                <p>Towards the end of the weekend, the team filmed a promotional video for the project, launching paper airplanes into the sky from the roof of the Betahaus co-working space.</p>

                <h2>The experience</h2>

                <p>The whole experience was an investigation into what could be achieved when combining the skills of such a varied group of individuals, with the added pressure of a time limit.</p>

                <p>The team learned what could realistically be achieved; what decisions needed to be made; and how to work together despite the difficult time constraints.</p>

                <p>The resulting product may not be perfect, but it's a reflection of what is achievable under the circumstances.</p>

                <h2>What next?</h2>

                <p>The team are already talking about the next event, which they hope will occur sometime during the summer.</p>

                <p>Until then they will be watching Fromto's progress on the App Store, and coming up with some more ideas for the next event.</p>
